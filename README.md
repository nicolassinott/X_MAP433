# X_MAP433
Homeworks from MAP433 course in Statistics from Ã‰cole Polytechnique (2nd year course)
<br>
<br>

This repository contains five different homeworks divided in two categories:

- exercice_numerique: usually shorter with more applied coding questions than theoretical.  
- homework: require a more indepth study of a certain method or problem and then apply the concepts in a short problem at the end.

Here a short description of each of the projects and the techniques used:

- exercice_numerique_01: Applied Linear Regression to study earth's surface temperature and determine if the increase in temperature is significative. The dataset can be found [here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/).
- exercice_numerique_02: Numerical problem on trying to estimate if a given population is distributed according to a normal distribussion using the Shapiro-Wilk test.
- exercice_numerique_03: Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data treatment, approached the problem with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), to afterwards determine the best classification model with a cross validation using K-fold. The problem was to classify if a patient would have breast cancer or not based on certain attributes. The dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29).

- homework_01: Study of the Linear Regression under the least squares methods for finding estimators. The method is after applied on a short problem that searchs to understand the ozone layer concentration.
- homework_02: Study of the Logistic Regression for classification problems, proving existence and unicity of the maximum likelyhood estimator when certain conditions are satisfeid. This statistical method is then applied on the famous titanic problem, the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data?select=train.csv).
